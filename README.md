# [Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster]

# [Predict survival on the Titanic : Overview]
-Collected data (has been split into two groups: training set (train.csv) and test set (test.csv)) from kaggle .
-Engineered features.
-Optimized K-Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier and GaussianNB to reach the best model.
-Created a tool that predicts survival on the Titanic.
